            "profile": "The furious, intellectual, and virtuosic revolution of the 1940s that became the foundation for all modern jazz.

            "profile": "A revolutionary approach pioneered in the late 1950s, Modal Jazz liberated improvisers by focusing on static scales (or modes) for long stretches, rather than rapidly changing chord progressions.
