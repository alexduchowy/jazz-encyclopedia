        { "year": 1958, "artist": "Miles Davis", "title": "Milestones", "album": "Milestones", "genre": "Modal Jazz", "cover": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3a/MilesDavisMilestones.jpg", "recordingDate": "February 4, 1958", "label": "Columbia", "lineup": "Miles Davis (trumpet), Cannonball Adderley (alto saxophone), John Coltrane (tenor saxophone), Red Garland (piano), Paul Chambers (bass), Philly Joe Jones (drums)", "analysis": "The title track is one of the first and most definitive examples of modal jazz. By stripping away complex chord changes in favor of static scales, Davis opened up vast new spaces for soloists, setting the stage for the revolution of 'Kind of Blue' the following year." },
        { "year": 1959, "artist": "Miles Davis", "title": "So What", "album": "Kind of Blue", "genre": "Modal Jazz", "cover": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9c/MilesDavisKindofBlue.jpg", "recordingDate": "March 2, 1959", "label": "Columbia", "lineup": "Miles Davis (trumpet), Cannonball Adderley (alto saxophone), John Coltrane (tenor saxophone), Bill Evans (piano), Paul Chambers (bass), Jimmy Cobb (drums)", "analysis": "'Kind of Blue' is the best-selling jazz album of all time and the ultimate statement of modal jazz. 'So What' is its iconic opener, built on just two scales (D Dorian and E-flat Dorian), allowing the all-star lineup to create solos of unprecedented melodic and emotional depth." },
        { "year": 1959, "artist": "Ornette Coleman", "title": "Lonely Woman", "album": "The Shape of Jazz to Come", "genre": "Free Jazz", "cover": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/ea/The_Shape_of_Jazz_to_Come.jpg", "recordingDate": "May 22, 1959", "label": "Atlantic", "lineup": "Ornette Coleman (alto saxophone), Don Cherry (cornet), Charlie Haden (bass), Billy Higgins (drums)", "analysis": "This album was a seismic shock to the jazz world. 'Lonely Woman' is a haunting, beautiful melody played with a crying tone by Coleman over a driving, free rhythm. The group completely abandons chord changes, relying instead on melodic empathy and collective improvisation, truly defining 'the shape of jazz to come.'" },
        { "year": 1960, "artist": "John Coltrane", "title": "Giant Steps", "album": "Giant Steps", "genre": "Hard Bop", "cover": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/cf/John_Coltrane_-_Giant_Steps.png", "recordingDate": "May 5, 1959", "label": "Atlantic", "lineup": "John Coltrane (tenor saxophone), Tommy Flanagan (piano), Paul Chambers (bass), Art Taylor (drums)", "analysis": "A pinnacle of hard bop complexity, 'Giant Steps' is famous for its rapid, difficult chord progression that moves through three key centers. Coltrane's blistering solo, navigating these changes with breathtaking speed and precision, established a new benchmark for technical virtuosity in jazz." },
        { "year": 1961, "artist": "Oliver Nelson", "title": "Stolen Moments", "album": "The Blues and the Abstract Truth", "genre": "Post-Bop", "cover": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a2/The_Blues_and_the_Abstract_Truth.jpg", "recordingDate": "February 23, 1961", "label": "Impulse!", "lineup": "Oliver Nelson (alto saxophone, tenor saxophone), Freddie Hubbard (trumpet), Eric Dolphy (alto saxophone, flute), Bill Evans (piano), Paul Chambers (bass), Roy Haynes (drums)", "analysis": "A masterpiece of arranging and composition, this album blends the structure of the blues with modern, 'abstract' harmonies. 'Stolen Moments' is a sophisticated, minor-key blues that gives its all-star cast, including a fiery Freddie Hubbard and an 'outside'-leaning Eric Dolphy, a perfect canvas for expression." },
        { "year": 1962, "artist": "Dexter Gordon", "title": "Cheese Cake", "album": "Go", "genre": "Hard Bop", "cover": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/7e/Dexter_Gordon_Go.jpg", "recordingDate": "August 27, 1962", "label": "Blue Note", "lineup": "Dexter Gordon (tenor saxophone), Sonny Clark (piano), Butch Warren (bass), Billy Higgins (drums)", "analysis": "After years in Europe, tenor titan Dexter Gordon returned to the US with this explosive album. 'Go' is considered one of the definitive hard bop records, and 'Cheese Cake' showcases Gordon's huge, commanding tone, laid-back swing, and masterful improvisational storytelling." },
        { "year": 1963, "artist": "Charles Mingus", "title": "Theme for Lester Young", "album": "The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady", "genre": "Third Stream, Avant-Garde", "cover": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8a/The_Black_Saint_and_the_Sinner_Lady.jpg", "recordingDate": "January 20, 1963", "label": "Impulse!", "lineup": "Charles Mingus (bass, piano), Rolf Ericson (trumpet), Richard Williams (trumpet), Quentin Jackson (trombone), Don Butterfield (tuba), Jerome Richardson (reeds), Dick Hafer (reeds), Charlie Mariano (alto saxophone), Jaki Byard (piano), Jay Berliner (guitar), Dannie Richmond (drums)", "analysis": "A monumental work conceived as a single, continuous ballet, this album is one of Mingus's greatest achievements. It's a swirling orchestral masterpiece that blends jazz, blues, gospel, and Spanish influences, full of passion, politics, and raw emotion." },
        { "year": 1964, "artist": "Eric Dolphy", "title": "Hat and Beard", "album": "Out to Lunch!", "genre": "Avant-Garde Jazz", "cover": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/32/Eric_Dolphy_-_Out_to_Lunch.jpg", "recordingDate": "February 25, 1964", "label": "Blue Note", "lineup": "Eric Dolphy (alto saxophone, flute, bass clarinet), Freddie Hubbard (trumpet), Bobby Hutcherson (vibraphone), Richard Davis (bass), Tony Williams (drums)", "analysis": "A landmark of the 1960s avant-garde, 'Out to Lunch!' uses a radical young rhythm section to create a sound that is both free and highly structured. 'Hat and Beard,' a tribute to Thelonious Monk, features wide, angular intervals and a unique sonic tapestry woven by Dolphy's bass clarinet, Hubbard's trumpet, and Hutcherson's shimmering vibes." },
        { "year": 1964, "artist": "Wayne Shorter", "title": "Witch Hunt", "album": "Speak No Evil", "genre": "Post-Bop", "cover": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e6/Wayne_Shorter_-_Speak_No_Evil.jpg", "recordingDate": "December 24, 1964", "label": "Blue Note", "lineup": "Wayne Shorter (tenor saxophone), Freddie Hubbard (trumpet), Herbie Hancock (piano), Ron Carter (bass), Elvin Jones (drums)", "analysis": "'Speak No Evil' is a cornerstone of the post-bop movement. Shorter's compositions are mysterious and open-ended, creating a dark, searching mood. 'Witch Hunt' is a powerful, modal-influenced piece driven by Elvin Jones's polyrhythmic drumming, showcasing the brilliant interplay between Shorter and trumpeter Freddie Hubbard." },
        { "year": 1965, "artist": "Herbie Hancock", "title": "Maiden Voyage", "album": "Maiden Voyage", "genre": "Modal Jazz, Post-Bop", "cover": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/37/Maiden_Voyage.jpg", "recordingDate": "March 17, 1965", "label": "Blue Note", "lineup": "Herbie Hancock (piano), Freddie Hubbard (trumpet), George Coleman (tenor saxophone), Ron Carter (bass), Tony Williams (drums)", "analysis": "A concept album built around a nautical theme, 'Maiden Voyage' is one of the most beloved jazz records ever made. The title track is a perfect example of Hancock's genius for creating harmonically sophisticated yet accessible music. The open, airy feel and iconic melody have made it a timeless jazz standard." },
        { "year": 1965, "artist": "John Coltrane", "title": "Acknowledgement", "album": "A Love Supreme", "genre": "Spiritual Jazz, Avant-Garde", "cover": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9a/John_Coltrane_-_A_Love_Supreme.jpg", "recordingDate": "December 9, 1964", "label": "Impulse!", "lineup": "John Coltrane (tenor saxophone), McCoy Tyner (piano), Jimmy Garrison (bass), Elvin Jones (drums)", "analysis": "A towering spiritual statement, 'A Love Supreme' is a four-part suite dedicated to God. 'Acknowledgement' opens the suite with its iconic four-note bass riff, which Coltrane then uses as a vocal chant. It's a work of profound intensity and spiritual searching that remains one of the most important albums in music history." },
        { "year": 1966, "artist": "Miles Davis", "title": "Footprints", "album": "Miles Smiles", "genre": "Post-Bop", "cover": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/62/Miles_Davis_-_Miles_Smiles.jpg", "recordingDate": "October 24, 1966", "label": "Columbia", "lineup": "Miles Davis (trumpet), Wayne Shorter (tenor saxophone), Herbie Hancock (piano), Ron Carter (bass), Tony Williams (drums)", "analysis": "'Miles Smiles' captures the Second Great Quintet at the peak of its powers. Wayne Shorter's 'Footprints' (a modified blues in 6/4 time) becomes a launchpad for the band's near-telepathic interplay. They stretch and deconstruct the form at will, showcasing a new level of 'controlled freedom' that defined post-bop." },
        { "year": 1967, "artist": "McCoy Tyner", "title": "Passion Dance", "album": "The Real McCoy", "genre": "Post-Bop", "cover": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f3/The_Real_McCoy_album_cover.jpg", "recordingDate": "April 21, 1967", "label": "Blue Note", "lineup": "McCoy Tyner (piano), Joe Henderson (tenor saxophone), Ron Carter (bass), Elvin Jones (drums)", "analysis": "After leaving John Coltrane's group, pianist McCoy Tyner recorded this powerful statement as a leader. 'Passion Dance' is pure energy, built on Tyner's signature quartal harmonies and thunderous, percussive piano style. Joe Henderson's blistering tenor solo perfectly matches the tune's intensity, making this an essential post-bop recording." }
