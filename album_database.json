Max Roach's explosive, layered drumming, particularly his use of the cowbell, is not mere accompaniment but a crucial part of the conversation. 'Un Poco Loco' showcased a more complex, darker, and rhythmically adventurous side of bebop, profoundly influencing the hard bop that would follow."

Clifford Brown's solo is a masterclass in bebop vocabulary and execution, while Sonny Rollins matches his intensity with a powerful and inventive solo of his own, all propelled by Max Roach's explosive drumming."
